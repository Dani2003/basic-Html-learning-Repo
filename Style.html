            Dear Sir,
                      I am writing to bring to your attention the financial struggles that many unviersity students are facing. As tuition cost continoue to rise, many students are finding it incresingly diffcult to afford their education. 
                      This financial burden is taking a toll on students academic performance and overall well-being. Many are forced to work multiple jobs while attending school, which leaves little time for studying and extra cirrcular activities. Others are forced to take out high interset loans in order to pay for their education.
                      I believe that this issue deserve more attention from the government and the media. Universities should be a place for students to focus on their education and not have to worry about how they are going to pay for it.
                      I urge you to consider this important issue and bring awarness to the financial struggles that university students are facing.
            Your Truly,
            XYZ
